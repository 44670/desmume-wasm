# Performance

Most 2D games could be run at 60fps on A14-based devices. 

However, the performance of 3D games varies for each game, an A15-based device could run most 3D games at nearly full speed.

By default, power-saving mode is enabled, which will limit the frame rate to 30fps. It is strongly recommended to enable this mode on A14-based devices to protect battery life and keep the temperature comfortable for playing. 

On A15-based devices, this mode could be disabled if you want to have a smoother experience.
